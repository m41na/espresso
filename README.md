Espresso is a Java-based, express-like, web framework whose main goals are;

1. to flatten the learning curve in adopting a Java-based web framework for individuals already familiar with express
2. bring onboard a very easy and friendly web development style to java
3. take advantage of new features in the java ecosystem, like jms (java module system)
4. externalize functionality that is specific to the web application in the form of middleware extensions
5. allow customization of concerns view engines and content body parsers in the form of plugins

_Espresso_ is the _entry class_ into the main application. _Jipress_ is the project name in _GitHub_. Both names can be
used interchangeably to refer to the same thing without loss of meaning. Feel free to do so.
