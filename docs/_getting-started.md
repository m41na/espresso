## Getting started

There are different ways one can make use of Jipress

1. include jars as java dependencies in a project using the embedded server (coming soon)
   
    a. using gradle
    
    b. using maven

2. use a docker image to create a container, and then add plugins to a designated plugins folder

Visit the project's home in [docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/m41na/espresso/general)

3. clone from github and build the respective jars files from source code

Visit the project's home in [github](https://github.com/jipress/espresso)

Whichever way someone chooses to make use of the framework, the bottom line is that one can either

1. Extend the framework to add functionality

2. Develop plugins to add new or enhanced existing functionality to the framework
